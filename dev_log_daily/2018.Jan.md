DID:
- Env setup
- CV plan outline
- Sync average-pooled hardware solution from Mechanic Department

TODO:
- Further env setup
- Implementation of algos
- Bot Construction

NOTE:
It seems to be a good idea to mount some sort of more power devices--more powerful than the RoboRio, directly on the robot. Wireless communication, which seems to be the best solution, is banned...

Team 254 seems to have a good solution attaching a adb from roborio to an android device. I doubt it's the best solution. 

The laptop came with team kit seems to be a good device to be utilized.

DID:
- More env setup...
- Enhanced cv performance
- Robot circuit build

TODO:
- None of the above got completed

NOTE:
Due to a shortage of tools, we were forced to use workarounds like using the hammer to replace the wire holder compressor....

More work still need to be done on building the simulation environment and the actual deployment environment. WPILIB has compilation problems to be solved.
