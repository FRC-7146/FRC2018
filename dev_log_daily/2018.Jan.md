DID:
- Env setup
- CV plan outline
- Sync average-pooled hardware solution from Mechanic Department

TODO:
- Further env setup
- Implementation of algos
- Bot Construction

NOTE:
It seems to be a good idea to mount some sort of more power devices--more powerful than the RoboRio, directly on the robot. Wireless communication, which seems to be the best solution, is banned...

Team 254 seems to have a good solution attaching a adb from roborio to an android device. I doubt it's the best solution. 

The laptop came with team kit seems to be a good device to be utilized.

DID:
- More env setup...
- Enhanced cv performance
- Robot circuit build

TODO:
- None of the above got completed

NOTE:
Due to a shortage of tools, we were forced to use workarounds like using the hammer to replace the wire holder compressor....

More work still need to be done on building the simulation environment and the actual deployment environment. WPILIB has compilation problems to be solved.

DID:
- Robot chassis building almost done
- Wiring almost done

TODO:
- Firmware flashing of router/Roborio
- More Wiring

NOTE:
This year `frcsim` is not suported... This is a big con for us. An alternative is to use the 2017 version instead and ignore the depreciation of APIs. Let's see

The wire runs short while building, more to be purchased. 

Flashing router with and external power source failed. Reason deduced to be the limited power of the power supply, while a 2A power source is required. More to be tested with standard power supply.
