DID:
- Env setup
- CV plan outline
- Sync average-pooled hardware solution from Mechanic Department

TODO:
- Further env setup
- Implementation of algos
- Bot Construction

NOTE:
It seems to be a good idea to mount some sort of more power devices--more powerful than the RoboRio, directly on the robot. Wireless communication, which seems to be the best solution, is banned...

Team 254 seems to have a good solution attaching a adb from roborio to an android device. I doubt it's the best solution. 

The laptop came with team kit seems to be a good device to be utilized.
