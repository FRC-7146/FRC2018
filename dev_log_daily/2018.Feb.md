### 2018年 02月 01日 星期四 21:56:03 CST
DID:
- Package up all component for lab migration
- Clean up code and add enhancements to command management

TODO:
- Everything else

NOTE:
This is a light-weight day where most of the time are spent on cleaning up the lab and disassembling materials due to the incoming lab migration. Main development should begin on Saturday. 

### 2018年 02月 03日 星期日 09:38:22 CST
DID:
- Reassembled chassis after lab migration
- Add partially finished pid control for chassis

TODO:
- Purchase accelerator/gyro..
- Finish and test chassis pid

NOTE:
A busy day without much progress except recovering the environment. 

### 2018年 02月 04日 星期一 09:26:35 CST
DID:
- Installed Gyro and get it working
- Angle pid half done
- Change chassis drive mode to asynchronous
- Add priority level for command

TODO:
- Finish chassis control loop
- Finish Angle pid (Use tanh instead of f(x)=x/n for Angle to [-1,1] mapping)
- Utilized built-in accelerometer

NOTE:
This is a day with many major changes...

I found that asychronous chassis control, where control process is separated into system call and kernel dispatch...like linux. This looks way safer and way more friendly to PID controls and similar stuff... 

Also, command priority is another important feature I believed will be able to come in handy later in the development. (***Higher priority value means lower priority!***)Let's see.
